Spring Boot application that has REST API to purchase items. The request and response body should be in JSON format. 


Accept the information below as request: 

UserId 

list of items bought: itemId and amount 


payment method chosen by user: gopay, ovo, etc 

More detailed user information and items information can be accessed directly from the database within the application. 


The application calculates the price of items bought by the user then makes API to payment gateway. 


Assume the gopay has API as below to pay and immediately response if successful. 
POST https://www.gopay.com/user/${user_telephone_number}/pay 
{  "amount": 250000  }

Define the REST API request and response 
Create a Java project using your preferred editor

No need to build a complete running project. Just a prototype with empty methods is fine, but it should show: 


The design of the package structures and the classes.  

The use of any Spring MVC aspects and design patterns that you think are appropriate. 


You are allowed to google for references or read notes/books, as no one is expected to know/remember everything. But you need to put your browser in the screen share while youâ€™re doing so. 

What scenarios should be tested, and how to test the code.
